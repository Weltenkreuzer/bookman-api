It supports the newly required Request Signatures which can be a bit tedious to generate on your own. [Learn more about the Amazon Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html).\n\nnode-apac is just a thin wrapper around Amazon's API. The only intent is to take care of request signatures, performing the HTTP requests, processing the responses and parsing the XML. You should be able to run any operation becuase the operation and all parameters are passed directly to the execute method just as they will be passed to Amazon. The result is that you feel likely you're working directly with the API, but you don't have to worry about some of the more teadious tasks.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall using npm:\n```bash\n$ npm install apac@latest\n```\n\nIf you try to install without \"@latest\", it will try to install the most recent stable\nversion, but there is no stable version yet. So for now you must specify latest.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nHere's a quick example:\n```javascript\nvar util = require('util'),\n    OperationHelper = require('apac').OperationHelper;\n\nvar opHelper = new OperationHelper({\n    awsId:     '[YOUR AWS ID HERE]',\n    awsSecret: '[YOUR AWS SECRET HERE]',\n    assocId:   '[YOUR ASSOCIATE TAG HERE]'\n    // xml2jsOptions: an extra, optional, parameter for if you want to pass additional options for the xml2js module. (see https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js#options)\n});\n\n\n// execute(operation, params, callback, onError)\n// operation: select from http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/SummaryofA2SOperations.html\n// params: parameters for operation (optional)\n// callback(parsed, raw): callback function handling results. parsed = xml2js parsed response. raw = raw xml response\n// onError: function handling errors, otherwise all error messages are printed with console.log()\n\nopHelper.execute('ItemSearch', {\n  'SearchIndex': 'Books',\n  'Keywords': 'harry potter',\n  'ResponseGroup': 'ItemAttributes,Offers'\n}, function(results) { // you can add a second parameter here to examine the raw xml response\n\tconsole.log(results);\n});\n\n// output:\n// { ItemSearchResponse: \n//    { '$': { xmlns: 'http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/2011-08-01' },\n//      OperationRequest: [ [Object] ],\n//      Items: [ [Object] ] } }\n```\n\nResults are returned as a JSON object (XML results parsed using xml2js -- thanks pierrel).\n\n## API Documentation\n\nBecause we don't define any specific operations, we also don't document them. What a waste\nwhen you can find them all here:\n[API Reference](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/index.html?ProgrammingGuide.html)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 Dustin McQuay.
